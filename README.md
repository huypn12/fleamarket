# fleamarket-backend
Serverside code for "fleamarket", my assignment project on Structured Programming course.
What it do is to provide some webservices for user to exchange, buy or sell their second-hand things.
Although it runs (yes, to make it run is to pass this course), there are so many incompleted pieces.
I need to fix them soon.
